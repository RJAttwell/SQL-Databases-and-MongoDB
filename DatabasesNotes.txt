Databases Notes:

- On the blog website project, posts on the home page would disappear after refreshing. 
- This was due to storing all the post data inside an array.
- There are many different kinds of databases.
- The type of data and the structure of your data will factor into which database you choose. 
- The main difference between databases is whether they are SQL or NoSQL.
 
- SQL = Structured Query Language (Ex: MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- NoSQL = Not Only Structured Query Language (Ex: mongoDB, Redis)

SQL: 
- Structured 
- Useful for predefined data structure 
- Relational database
- As the amount of data gets larger and larger, SQL will slow down and struggle. Can be costly scaling with SQL.

NoSQL:
- Flexible and adaptable 
- Data will be represented as JSON Objects
- Key value pairs
- If there is an extra key value pair, it won't affect anything else 
- Non relational database
- NoSQL's scalability is a strongpoint
- Allows for a distributed system

- If you need to store information that can relate to each other such as orders, product IDs, customer names, etc. it may be better to choose an SQL database 

- A website with a lot of information being generated, it'll be easier to use a NoSQL database 

MySQL:
- More Mature
- Table Structure
- Requires a scheme
- Great with data that has a lot of relationships between each other
- Scales "vertically". Requires more infrastructure. More costly.

MongoDB:
- May have more changes due to being a newer techology 
- Document Structure
- More flexible to changes 
- Not great with complex relationships 
- Scales "horizontally". Easier to scale. Distributes well.
