MongoDB Notes:

- NoSQL Database
- When installing, make sure the package is MSI (installation wizard)


- VIM:
    - vim [file name] to activate Vim 
    - Type in 'i' ti begin the INSERT mode 
    - Can find written installation for MongoDB on their website 
    - Check MongoDB version by typing in 'mongod --version'
    - May have to add in both vim and MongoDB paths to PATH section in environment variables

- One of the first things you should do with a new database is research how to perform CRUD with it 
- https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/

- Typing mongod into terminal will start a local server 
- Make new tab in hyper terminal as you cannot type in the server tab 
- Type in mongosh (mongo does not work with the shell anymore. You will have to download the mongosh shell - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
